## 📌 Reminders

- `.exe` files you create will not be uploaded to the remote repository (this page) because of the [.gitignore file](.gitignore); you will have to rebuild any `.exe` file when changes to its `.c` file have been made.
- It's a good practice to fetch any changes made to the remote repository before pushing your own changes. Unless a merge conflict appears, you can then pull those changes and push your own changes.

## 📖 Terminology
**Repository**: A repository is a storage location (local or remote) that contains a project's files, history, and version control metadata. The page you're looking at right now is the remote repository for Machine Problem 1.

**Clone**: Cloning creates a local copy of the remote repository, allowing you to work on the project independently.

**Push**: Pushing uploads your local changes to the remote repository, making them available to others.

**Fetch**: Fetching downloads updates from the remote repository without (yet) applying them to your local copy.

**Pull**: Pulling fetches remote changes and attempts to merge them into your local copy.

**Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict happens during a pull or push when local and remote changes modify the same part of a file, requiring manual resolution before merging.
