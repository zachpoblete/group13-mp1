## ðŸ“– Terminology
**Repository**: A repository is a storage location (local or remote) that contains a project's files, history, and version control metadata. The page you're looking at right now is the remote repository for Machine Problem 1.

**Clone**: Cloning creates a local copy of the remote repository, allowing you to work on the project independently.

**Push**: Pushing uploads your local changes to the remote repository, making them available to others.

**Pull**: Pulling fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository into your local copy.

**Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when two changes affect the same part of a file, requiring manual resolution before merging.
